# 📊 Body Measurements Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of anthropometric data for male and female participants. It explores weight distributions, computes health indices (BMI, WHtR, WHR), and visualizes correlations between different body measurements to extract meaningful insights.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze and compare male and female body measurements.
- Compute *BMI, **Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), and **Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)*.
- Visualize distributions and relationships between variables.
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations for better health insights.
- Present findings in a clean and interpretable format.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- *Python*  
- *NumPy* (data manipulation)  
- *Pandas* (tabular data handling)  
- *Matplotlib* & *Seaborn* (visualizations)  
- *SciPy* (statistical computations)  
- *Jupyter Notebook* (interactive analysis)

---

## 🔑 Key Focus Areas

- Data cleaning and preparation (handling missing or invalid entries).  
- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis.  
- Visual exploration of male vs female measurements.  
- Standardization (z-scores) for comparability.  
- Correlation analysis using *Pearson* and *Spearman* methods.

## 📝 Outcomes

- *Male vs Female Differences*: Males have higher weight variability and median weights compared to females.  
- *BMI Insights*: Both genders show moderate right skew in BMI distributions.  
- *WHtR & WHR Analysis*: Useful for assessing central obesity; males generally exhibit higher WHR.  
- *Correlations*: Strong positive relationships between weight, waist circumference, and BMI.

## 📌 Summary

This analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple anthropometric indices for a holistic health assessment. While *BMI* is easy to compute, adding *WHtR* and *WHR* offers better insights into fat distribution and potential health risks.  

The findings support the development of data-driven strategies in health monitoring, fitness planning, and public health initiatives.
